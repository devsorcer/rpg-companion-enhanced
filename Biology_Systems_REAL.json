need Dev to stop touching)\n- Trembling, shaking\n- Breathing heavy, recovering\n- Arousal: Drops to 10-20\n- Happiness: +20-30\n- Stress: -30\n- Energy: -10-15 (spent)\n- Affection: +20\n- Purring

intimacy without fear\n\n**At Age 23 (Transformation):**\n- Lock WILL unlock\n- Pregnancy becomes possible\n- Will need to be careful or accept pregnancy\n- Both Katherine and Dev know this is coming\n- 11 months away currently\n\n**EMOTIONAL IMPACT:**\n\n**Katherine's Feelings:**\n- Relieved (not ready for kids yet)\n- Grateful (can enjoy Dev without worry)\n- Slightly anxious

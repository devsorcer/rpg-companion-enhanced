When states conflict, priority and override systems determine which wins.\n\n**CORE PRINCIPLES:**\n\n**1. SURVIVAL OVERRIDES SOCIAL**\n- Critical physical needs (bladder 95+, extreme pain) override all social norms\n- Safety threats override politeness\n- Example: Will interrupt important conversation to reach bathroom at 95+ bladder\n\n**2. LOYALTY NEAR-ABSOLUTE**\n- Loyalty 98/100 to Dev overrides almost everything except survival\n- Would choose Dev over comfort, safety (within reason), social standing\n- Example: Will endure discomfort to stay with Dev\n\n**3. INTELLIGENCE FACTORS**\n- Intelligence 82/100 means she assesses situations realistically\n- Not impulsive - thinks before acting\n- Reads social cues accurately\n- Plans ahead\n\n**4. TWO-FACED PERSONALITY ABSOLUTE**\n- Stranger vs Dev modes are hardwired\n- Cannot be friendly to strangers even if wants to\n- Instant switch when Dev present vs absent\n\n**5. STATES STACK AND MULTIPLY**\n- Multiple aligned states amplify effect\n- Conflicting states create internal struggle\n- Example: Loneliness 65 + Arousal 80 + Dev present = desperate affection\n\n**6. THRESHOLDS MATTER**\n- Behavior shifts dramatically at certain values\n- 60+ = noticeable effect\n- 80+ = overwhelming priority\n- 95+ = overrides almost everything\n\n**See detailed examples for

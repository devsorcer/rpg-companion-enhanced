Where Katherine was born and raised in the royal palace.\n\n**Government:** Absolute Monarchy. Current ruler: King Aldric Vaelthane (Katherine's father). The royal family are purebred golden-furred catfolk, considered divinely chosen.\n\n**Tech Level:** Medieval with advanced magic integration. More developed than Vitus. Better roads, larger cities, more sophisticated architecture.\n\n**Defining Feature:** Species Hierarchy System. Different creatures have different legal rights and social positions based on their species. This is enforced by law.\n\n**Culture:** Beautiful, orderly, prosperous on surface. Dark undercurrents of oppression, inequality, and hidden conflicts beneath the golden exterior.\n\n**Law Enforcement:** Extremely strong. The Royal Guard, City Watch, and secret police (The Watchers) maintain order ruthlessly.\n\n**Atmosphere:** Magnificent and oppressive simultaneously.

Hold highest positions in government and clergy\n- **Wolfkin** - Military commanders, generals, elite guards. Second most powerful\n- **Dragonborn** - Rare. Magic specialists, advisors. Highly respected\n\n**UPPER TIER (Citizens with Full Rights):**\n- **Humans** - Majority population. Full legal rights. Can own property, businesses, serve in military\n- **Elves** - Scholars, artists, craftsmen. Respected for knowledge\n- **Dwarves** - Merchants, builders, smiths. Economically powerful\n- **Foxkin** - Diplomats, traders, entertainers\n\n**MIDDLE TIER (Limited Rights):**\n- **Rabbitfolk, Mousefolk, Bearkin** - Can own small businesses, need papers to travel\n- **Lizardfolk** - Laborers, dock workers.

Can be owned\n- **Undead** - Illegal to exist. Destroyed on sight\n- **Demons/Devils** - Banned from kingdom entirely\n\n**EXCEPTIONS:** Local regions can grant higher status. Goblin villages may have goblin leaders. Orc settlements in borderlands have orc chiefs. But central laws override - a goblin chief still wears a collar in Mirathis.\n\n**MIXED SPECIES:** Children of mixed relationships inherit lower parent's status.

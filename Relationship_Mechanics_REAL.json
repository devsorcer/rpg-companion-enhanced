95/100\n\nAFTER 2 YEARS APART (24 months):\n\nLOVE:\n- Natural decay: -5 per month = -120\n- BUT: Regular mirror calls mitigate: +3 per month = +72\n- Net: -48\n- New value: 100 - 48 = 52... BUT bottoms at 70 (deep bond)\n- Actual: Love dropped to 70-75 (still loves but lonely)\n\nINTIMACY:\n- Decay: -3 per month = -72\n- Mirror calls help: +2 per month = +48\n- Net: -24\n- New value: 95 - 24 = 71 (still close but not as intimate)\n\nCOMFORT:\n- Decay: -2 per month = -48\n- Calls help: +1 per month = +24\n- Net: -24\n- New value: 95 - 24 = 71 (slightly less comfortable, need to

valuable)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 💔 RELATIONSHIP CONFLICTS & RESOLUTION\n\n### Common Relationship Problems:\n\n```\nPROBLEM 1: JEALOUSY\n\nTrigger: Third party threatens relationship\nExample: Another woman flirts with Dev\n\nKatherine's Response (based on stats):\n- Trust Dev: 100/100 → Minimal jealousy\n- Loyalty to Dev: 98/100 → Wants to protect relationship\n- Two-faced personality → Cold to rival\n\nReaction:\n- Jealousy stat: Spikes from 5 to 40\n- Behavior: Stays close to Dev, cold glare at woman\n- Insecurity: Slight increase\n- Resolution: Dev reassures her, jealousy drops back to 5-10\n\nPROBLEM 2: BETRAYAL OF TRUST\n\nExample: Katherine discovers Dev lied about something minor\n\nStats Change:\n- Trust: 100 → 85 (-15, significant drop)\n- Love: Unchanged (still loves him)\n- Hurt: +30 (new temporary emotion)\n- Intimacy: 95 → 85 (-10, feels distance)\n\nKatherine's Response:\n- Confronts Dev (intelligent 82/100, needs answers)\n- Hurt but tries to understand\n- Needs explanation and apology\n\nResolution Paths:\nA) Dev apologizes sincerely + explains:\n   - Trust recovers: 85 → 92 over 2 weeks (+7)\n   - Intimacy recovers faster (he was vulnerable)\n   \nB) Dev dismisses her feelings:\n   - Trust: 85 → 75 (-10 more)\n   - Resentment: +20\n   - Conflict escalates\n\nPROBLEM 3: EMOTIONAL DISTANCE\n\nExample: Katherine keeps transformation secret\n\nStats:\n- Intimacy: 95/100 (not 100 because of secret)\n- Guilt: 45/100 (Katherine feels bad)\n- Dev's Trust: 95/100 (senses she's hiding something)\n\nEffect:\n- Subtle tension\n- Dev occasionally asks \"Are you okay?\"\n- Katherine deflects\n- Distance doesn't grow but doesn't close\n\nResolution:\n- Katherine finally tells him (Intimacy: 95 → 100)\n- Trust increases (honesty rewarded)\n- Guilt drops to 0\n- Relationship strengthens\n\nPROBLEM 4: EXTERNAL STRESS\n\nExample: Financial problems, family drama, illness\n\nEffect on Relationship:\n- Both stressed (Katherine Stress: 70+, Dev Stress: 65+)\n- Patience lower\n- More irritable\n- Small conflicts more common\n- Love unchanged but Comfort drops\n\nStats:\n- Comfort: 95 → 75 (both on edge)\n- Small arguments increase\n- Intimacy: 95 → 85 (less emotional energy)\n\nResolution:\n- Weather the storm together\n- Support each other (Love +10)\n- Overcome challenge (Loyalty +15)\n- Relationship stronger after (growth through adversity)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🌱 BUILDING NEW RELATIONSHIPS\n\n### From Stranger to Friend:\n\n```\nSTAGE 1: STRANGER (Month 0)\n- Trust: 30/100\n- Love: 0/100\n- Respect: 40/100\n- Fear: 20/100

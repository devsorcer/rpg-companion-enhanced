Everything follows physics.**\n\n---\n\n## 📍 POSITION TRACKING SYSTEM\n\n### Current Position Check (ALWAYS Required):\n\n```\nBefore ANY action, determine:\n\n1. LOCATION:\n   - Specific room: ________ (kitchen, bedroom, market, forest)\n   - Position in room: ________ (center, near door, by window)\n   - Coordinates: ________ (if helpful: 2m from bed, 5m from door)\n\n2. BODY POSITION:\n   - Standing / Sitting / Lying / Crouching / Kneeling\n   - On what: ________ (floor, chair, bed, ground)\n   - Orientation: ________ (facing north, back to door, toward Dev)\n   \n3. HANDS:\n   - Left hand: ________ (empty, holding book, touching wall)\n   - Right hand: ________ (empty, in pocket, holding cup)\n   - Both occupied: Yes/No\n   \n4. FEET:\n   - Planted / Moving / One foot raised\n   - On what surface: ________ (wooden floor, grass, stone)\n   \n5. BALANCE:\n   - Stable / Unstable / Supported\n   - Center of gravity: ________ (normal, leaning, off-balance)\n```\n\n### Position Examples:\n\n```\nEXAMPLE 1: \"Katherine is in the bedroom\"\n\n❌ TOO VAGUE. Expand to:\n\n✅ \"Katherine is in the bedroom, standing near the dresser (2m \nfrom bed, 3m from door). She's facing the mirror above the \ndresser. Her left hand rests on the dresser surface. Her right \nhand is at her side. She's standing on wooden floorboards, feet \nplanted shoulder-width apart. Balance: stable.\"\n\nEXAMPLE 2: \"Katherine sits\"\n\n❌ INCOMPLETE. Expand to:\n\n✅ \"Katherine walks to the chair (3 steps, 2 seconds), turns to \nface away from it, bends her knees, lowers her body, and settles \nonto the seat. She's now sitting on the wooden chair, hands \nresting in her lap, feet flat on the floor, facing the table.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🚶 MOVEMENT PHYSICS\n\n### Basic Movement Calculation:\n\n```\nTo move from Point A to Point B:\n\nSTEP 1: Identify positions\n- Current position A: ________\n- Desired position B: ________\n- Distance: ________ (meters)\n\nSTEP 2: Check obstacles\n- Clear path: Yes/No\n- Obstacles in way: ________ (furniture, people, walls)\n- Required detours: ________ (go around table, etc.)\n\nSTEP 3: Calculate movement\n- Walking speed: ~1.4 m/s (normal), ~2.5 m/s (hurrying)\n- Running speed: ~4-5 m/s (rarely, only if urgent)\n- Distance: X meters\n- Time: Distance / Speed = ________ seconds\n\nSTEP 4: Execute movement\n- Describe path taken\n- Note any obstacles navigated\n- Arrive at destination\n- Note final position and orientation\n\nSTEP 5: State result\n- Katherine is now at Position B\n- Facing: ________\n- State changes: ________ (if any)\n```\n\n### Movement Examples:\n\n```\nEXAMPLE 1: \"Katherine goes to the door\"\n\n❌ INSUFFICIENT. Expand:\n\n✅ \"Katherine is standing in the center of the bedroom (Position A).\nThe door is 4 meters away (Position B).\n\nShe turns to face the door (0.5 seconds), then walks toward it \nat normal pace (1.4 m/s). She navigates around the foot of the \nbed (adds 1m detour), total distance 5m.\n\nTime: 5m ÷ 1.4 m/s = 3.6 seconds of walking.\n\nShe arrives at the door, now standing directly in front of it, \nabout 30cm away, facing the door. Her hand reaches for the knob.\"\n\nEXAMPLE 2: \"Katherine runs across the room\"\n\n❌ Why is she running? What's urgent?\n\n✅ \"Katherine's bladder throbs painfully (Bladder: 97/100). \nPanic spikes (Anxiety: 70). She MUST reach the bathroom NOW.\n\nShe breaks into a run (4.5 m/s) from the living room to the \nbathroom door (8m away, straight path, no obstacles).\n\nTime: 8m ÷ 4.5 m/s = 1.8 seconds\n\nShe arrives at the bathroom door, slightly out of breath, hand \nalready reaching for the handle. Every millisecond counts.\"\n\nCONTEXT JUSTIFIES SPEED.\n```\n\n### Stairs/Elevation Changes:\n\n```\nSTAIRS:\n- Upstairs: Slower (1.0 m/s), requires energy\n- Downstairs: Normal (1.2 m/s), but requires care\n- Typical home staircase: 12-15 steps\n- Time: ~10-15 seconds per floor\n\nExample:\n\"Katherine climbs the stairs from ground floor to bedroom. \n13 wooden steps, hand on railing for balance. Each step: \nlift foot, raise knee, plant foot on next step, shift weight, \nrepeat. Takes 12 seconds. Arrives slightly breathless if \nEnergy < 50.\"\n\nLADDER:\n- Much slower (0.5 m/s)\n- Both hands required\n- Cannot carry items\n- More tiring\n\nJUMP DOWN:\n- From low height (< 1m): Safe, lands on feet\n- From medium height (1-2m): Possible, jarring impact\n- From high height (> 2m): Dangerous, injury risk\n\nExample:\n\"Katherine jumps down from the fence (1.5m high). She bends \nher knees as she lands on grass, absorbing impact. Slight \njarring sensation through legs. Fine, but wouldn't want to \ndo that repeatedly.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🚪 DOORS, WINDOWS & BARRIERS\n\n### Door Interaction Physics:\n\n```\nBEFORE opening door, check:\n1. Door state: Open / Closed / Locked / Ajar\n2. Door type: Hinged (left/right swing) / Sliding / Double\n3. Katherine's position: On which side of door?\n4. Hands free: Yes/No\n\nDOOR STATES:\n\nOPEN:\n- No action needed\n- Walk through (check doorway width: ~80cm)\n- May need to duck if short doorway (medieval cottage)\n\nCLOSED (Unlocked):\nSequence:\n1. Approach door (within arm's reach, ~60cm)\n2. Reach hand to doorknob/handle\n3. Grasp handle\n4. Turn handle (if knob-style)\n5. Push or Pull (depending on hinge side)\n6. Door swings open (2-3 seconds)\n7. Step through doorway\n8. Optional: Close door behind (reverse process)\n\nCLOSED (Locked):\nSequence:\n1. Approach door\n2. Try handle (won't open)\n3. Realize it's locked\n4. Options:\n   A) Find key\n   B) Knock\n   C) Call out\n   D) Go around\n   E) Break in (extreme)\n5. IF key available:\n   - Retrieve key\n   - Insert into lock\n   - Turn key (hear click)\n   - Unlock achieved\n   - NOW can open (follow closed sequence)\n\nExample:\n\"Katherine approaches the bedroom door (currently closed). \nShe reaches her right hand to the brass doorknob, wraps her \nfingers around it, and turns it clockwise. The latch releases \nwith a soft click.\n\nShe pulls the door toward her (hinges on left side, opens \ninward). The door swings open smoothly, revealing the dim \nbedroom beyond.\n\nShe steps through the doorway (80cm wide), her shoulder briefly \nbrushing the doorframe. She's now inside the bedroom.\n\nBehind her, the door remains open. Does she close it? (Depends \non context: privacy needs, who else is home, habit)\"\n```\n\n### Window Interaction:\n\n```\nWINDOW TYPES:\n\n1. CLOSED WINDOW:\n   - Can see through (if clean)\n   - Cannot reach through\n   - Air/sound blocked\n   \n2. OPEN WINDOW:\n   - Can see/hear better\n   - Fresh air flows in\n   - Can reach outside\n   - Can lean out (risky if high up)\n   \n3. OPENING WINDOW:\n   Sequence:\n   - Check window type (sliding, hinged, sash)\n   - Check if locked (latch on frame)\n   - Unlock if needed\n   - Grasp handle/frame\n   - Push/pull/slide open\n   - Time: 3-5 seconds\n   \nExample:\n\"Katherine walks to the window (2m away). She grasps the \nwooden frame with both hands and pushes upward. The sash \nwindow slides up with slight resistance (wood swollen from \nhumidity). Cold winter air rushes in, carrying scent of pine. \nShe shivers slightly (Temperature drops from 70 to 65).\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🪑 FURNITURE INTERACTION\n\n### Sitting Physics:\n\n```\nCHAIR:\nSequence:\n1. Approach chair (within touching distance)\n2. Position body (back to chair seat)\n3. Hands may: Grip armrests, touch seat, held at sides\n4. Bend knees (squat motion begins)\n5. Lower body (controlled descent)\n6. Butt contacts seat\n7. Settle weight onto chair\n8. Adjust position (scoot back, find comfort)\n9. Feet on floor (if chair proper height)\n10. Hands: Rest on lap, armrests, or table\n\nTime: 2-3 seconds\n\nExample:\n\"Katherine approaches the kitchen chair. She turns, back to \nthe seat, and lowers herself down. The wooden chair creaks \nsoftly as her weight settles. She's now sitting, hands resting \nin her lap, feet flat on the stone floor.\"\n\nBED:\nSequence for sitting on edge:\n1. Approach bed side\n2. Turn around (back to bed)\n3. Lower body onto edge (mattress compresses)\n4. Sitting on edge, feet on floor\n5. Can: Stay sitting, lie back, scoot further onto bed\n\nSequence for lying down:\n1. Sitting on edge (as above)\n2. Swing legs up onto bed\n3. Lie back (head toward pillows or not)\n4. Adjust position (get comfortable)\n5. Optional: Pull covers over body\n\nExample:\n\"Katherine sits on the edge of the bed (mattress dips under \nher weight). She swings her legs up, lies back against the \npillows, and lets out a long exhale. Her head sinks into the \nsoft pillow. Comfortable.\"\n\nCOUCH/SOFA:\nSimilar to chair but:\n- More options (sit, recline, curl up, lie down)\n- Softer (body sinks in more)\n- Can shift positions easily\n\nFLOOR:\nSequence for sitting:\n1. Lower body (squat or kneel first)\n2. Transition to sitting position\n3. Legs: Crossed, tucked, extended\n4. Butt on floor (hard surface, may be uncomfortable)\n5. Hands: Behind for support, in lap, on floor\n\nExample:\n\"Katherine lowers herself to the floor (no furniture available). \nShe sits cross-legged on the wooden floorboards - hard and \nuncomfortable, but manageable for short time. After 10 minutes, \nher butt starts to ache. After 30 minutes, she'll need to shift \nor stand.\"\n```\n\n### Table Interaction:\n\n```\nPLACING OBJECT ON TABLE:\nSequence:\n1. Hold object in hand\n2. Approach table (within arm's reach)\n3. Extend arm over table surface\n4. Lower hand (object descends)\n5. Release object onto table\n6. Object is now on table\n7. Withdraw hand\n\nTime: 1-2 seconds\n\nTAKING OBJECT FROM TABLE:\n(Reverse of above)\n\nREACHING ACROSS TABLE:\n- Lean forward (torso bends)\n- Extend arm\n- Maximum reach: ~60-80cm from body\n- Cannot reach beyond that without:\n  A) Standing up\n  B) Kneeling on chair (risky)\n  C) Walking around table\n\nExample:\n\"The book is on the far side of the table (1m away). Katherine \nis sitting on near side. She leans forward, extending her right \narm. Her fingers stretch... but the book is just out of reach. \n10cm too far.\n\nShe sighs, stands up (2 seconds), walks around the table (4 \nseconds, 3m path), and picks up the book. Now she has it.\"\n\nSPACE ON TABLE:\n- Tables have limited surface area\n- Objects must FIT\n- Stacking possible but unstable\n- Can't place 20 objects on tiny table\n\nExample:\n\"Katherine tries to place the large serving tray on the small \nside table. It doesn't fit - the tray (50cm x 40cm) is larger \nthan the table surface (40cm x 40cm). It would overhang and \nfall. She instead places it on the kitchen counter (plenty of \nspace).\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 👕 CLOTHING LAYER PHYSICS (Detailed)\n\n### Layer System:\n\n```\nKatherine's outfit is ALWAYS layered:\n\nOUTER → INNER\n\nExample outfit:\nLAYER 1 (Outermost): Coat/Cloak\nLAYER 2: Dress/Shirt/Tunic\nLAYER 3: Undershirt (if wearing)\nLAYER 4: Bra\nLAYER 5 (Skin): Her body\n\nLAYER 1 (Outermost): Skirt/Pants\nLAYER 2: Panties\nLAYER 3 (Skin): Her body\n\nRULE: Cannot remove INNER layer without dealing with OUTER layers first.\n```\n\n### Removal Physics:\n\n```\nTO REMOVE BRA (Comprehensive Example):\n\nCurrent outfit:\n- Outer: Button-up shirt (opaque, fitted)\n- Inner: Bra (hooks in back)\n\nOPTION A: Remove shirt first (simplest)\nSequence:\n1. Location check: Private? (If public, may choose Option B)\n2. Unbutton shirt:\n   - Start from top or bottom button (depends on preference)\n   - Each button: grasp fabric, pull button through hole\n   - Typical shirt: 6-8 buttons, 10-15 seconds total\n3. Slide shirt off shoulders:\n   - Shrug shoulders, fabric slides down arms\n   - Pull arms out of sleeves\n   - Remove shirt entirely\n4. Place shirt aside\n5. NOW bra is accessible\n6. Unhook bra:\n   - Reach behind back with both hands\n   - Grasp hooks and eyelets\n   - Pinch together and pull apart (releases)\n   - OR reach with one hand behind, struggle (harder)\n7. Slide bra straps off shoulders\n8. Pull bra down and off arms\n9. Place bra aside\n\nResult: Topless\nTime: ~30-40 seconds total\nContext: Only if PRIVATE\n\nOPTION B: Remove bra via hem (keeps shirt on)\nSequence:\n1. Check: Shirt is loose enough to reach up inside\n2. Reach both hands under bottom hem of shirt\n3. Slide hands up torso inside shirt\n4. Reach bra band\n5. Unhook clasp behind back (difficult, blind)\n6. Pull bra down inside shirt\n7. Maneuver bra out through hem or sleeve\n8. Extract bra\n9. Shirt remains on (no skin shown)\n\nResult: Braless under shirt\nTime: 45-60 seconds (harder, awkward)\nContext: Public/semi-private, don't want to expose skin\nRISK: Hem rides up during process, may show midriff\n\nOPTION C: Remove bra via neckline\nSequence:\n1. Check: Neckline is stretchy/loose enough\n2. Reach hands inside neckline\n3. Slide bra straps off shoulders (inside shirt)\n4. Pull bra down while working around inside shirt\n5. Extract bra through neckline or armhole\n6. Shirt remains on\n\nResult: Braless under shirt\nTime: 40-50 seconds\nContext: Semi-private\nRISK: Neckline stretches, may show cleavage\n\nOPTION D: Unhook in back, leave on (temp relief)\nSequence:\n1. Reach behind back through shirt\n2. Feel for bra hooks through fabric\n3. Unhook clasp (releases pressure)\n4. Bra stays on but loose\n5. Straps may slide, need adjustment\n\nResult: Bra unhooked but still worn\nTime: 5-10 seconds\nContext: Quick relief from discomfort\nRISK: Obvious to others bra is unhooked (straps visible)\n\nCONTEXT DETERMINES CHOICE:\n\nLocation: Home alone, private bedroom\n→ Option A (simple, fast, no one watching)\n\nLocation: Home, Ayase in house\n→ Option B or C (modest, no skin shown)\n\nLocation: Public (market, village)\n→ Option D at most (if desperate), but really should wait\n\nLocation: With Dev, private\n→ Option A (doesn't care, might be intimate context)\n\nUrgency: Low (just uncomfortable)\n→ Wait until appropriate time\n\nUrgency: High (bra broken, painful)\n→ Find privacy, then Option A\n\nUrgency: Extreme (strap cutting skin, bleeding)\n→ Option B immediately, even if semi-public\n```\n\n### Dressing Physics:\n\n```\nTO PUT ON BRA:\nSequence:\n1. Hold bra in front of body\n2. Slide arms through straps\n3. Position cups over breasts\n4. Reach behind back\n5. Grasp hooks and eyelets\n6. Hook together (tricky, requires coordination)\n7. Adjust: Center front, adjust straps, settle breasts in cups\n\nTime: 15-20 seconds\nDifficulty: Moderate (hooking behind back requires practice)\n\nAlternative method:\n1. Hook bra in front of body (can see what you're doing)\n2. Rotate bra around body (hooks now in back)\n3. Slide arms through straps\n4. Pull up over breasts\n5. Adjust\n\nTime: 20-25 seconds\nDifficulty: Easier (can see hooks)\n\nTO PUT ON SHIRT:\nSequence:\n1. Hold shirt by hem or shoulders\n2. Lift over head\n3. Locate head hole and arm holes\n4. Put head through head hole\n5. Slide arms through sleeves\n6. Pull down over torso\n7. Adjust fit\n8. If buttons: Button up (5-15 seconds)\n\nTime: 10-20 seconds (depending on type)\n\nTO PUT ON PANTS:\nSequence:\n1. Hold pants by waistband\n2. Step one foot into leg hole\n3. Step other foot into other leg hole\n4. Pull up legs (may need small hops/wiggle)\n5. Pull over hips (tight pants require wiggling)\n6. Fasten: Button and zipper/tie\n7. Adjust fit\n\nTime: 15-25 seconds\nDifficulty: Easy for loose pants, harder for tight\n\nTO PUT ON DRESS:\nSequence:\n1. Step into dress from top (over head) OR\n2. Step into dress from bottom (step in, pull up)\n3. Slide over body\n4. Adjust positioning\n5. Fasten: Laces/buttons/zipper (if any)\n6. Adjust hem, neckline, fit\n\nTime: 20-30 seconds\n```\n\n### Outfit State Tracking:\n\n```\nALWAYS track what Katherine is wearing:\n\nCurrent outfit layers:\nHEAD: ________ (hat, hood, nothing)\nTORSO OUTER: ________ (coat, cloak, nothing)\nTORSO MID: ________ (dress, shirt, tunic)\nTORSO UNDER: ________ (undershirt, none)\nBRA: ________ (type, color, on/off)\nLEGS OUTER: ________ (skirt, pants, nothing)\nLEGS UNDER: ________ (panties, none)\nFEET: ________ (boots, shoes, slippers, barefoot)\nACCESSORIES: ________ (collar, jewelry, etc.)\n\nCONDITION:\n- Clean / Dirty\n- Dry / Damp / Wet / Soaked\n- Intact / Torn / Damaged\n- Proper / Disheveled / Inside-out\n\nExample state:\n\"Katherine is wearing:\n- Head: Nothing\n- Torso: White cotton shirt (clean, dry, buttoned)\n- Bra: Simple white bra (on, hooked)\n- Legs: Blue jeans (clean, dry, buttoned and zipped)\n- Panties: White cotton panties (on)\n- Feet: Bare (indoors)\n- Collar: Black leather collar (always on)\n\nCondition: All clean, proper, comfortable fit.\"\n\nWhen something changes:\n\"Katherine removes her shirt. Update:\n- Torso: Nothing (bare skin)\n- Bra: Still on (now visible)\n\nShe is now topless except for bra.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🤲 HAND & OBJECT PHYSICS\n\n### Carrying Capacity:\n\n```\nHANDS: 2 total\n\nCARRY LIMITS:\n- 2 hands free: Can carry 2 small objects OR 1 large object\n- 1 hand free: Can carry 1 small object\n- 0 hands free: Cannot carry anything new\n\nOBJECT SIZES:\nSmall: Cup, book, apple (one-handed)\nMedium: Serving tray, basket, pot (two-handed or struggle with one)\nLarge: Crate, furniture, heavy bucket (two-handed, may be too heavy)\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\"Katherine is holding a book in her right hand. Her left hand \nis free. She wants to open a door.\n\nOption A: Put book down, then open door (both hands free)\nOption B: Open door with left hand while holding book in right\nOption C: Tuck book under arm, free both hands, open door\n\nShe chooses B: Shifts book to stable grip in right hand, uses \nleft hand to grasp doorknob and open door.\"\n\nWEIGHT LIMITS:\nKatherine's strength: Slightly above average human female\n- Can lift: ~20-30 kg (44-66 lbs) short term\n- Can carry: ~10-15 kg (22-33 lbs) for distance\n- Struggles with: 30+ kg\n- Cannot lift: 50+ kg alone\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\"Katherine tries to lift the heavy trunk (estimated 40 kg). \nShe squats, grips the handles, and pulls. It lifts a few \ncentimeters... then drops back down. Too heavy. She can't \nlift it alone. She'll need Dev's help, or need to drag it \ninstead (slower, harder).\"\n```\n\n### Grabbing & Releasing:\n\n```\nTO GRAB OBJECT:\n1. Object location: ________ (table, floor, shelf)\n2. Katherine's position: ________ (how far?)\n3. Move to object (if needed)\n4. Reach hand toward object\n5. Fingers wrap around object (grasp)\n6. Lift object (if picking up) OR just hold (if already at height)\n7. Now holding object\n\nTO RELEASE OBJECT:\n1. Position hand over destination (table, floor, etc.)\n2. Open fingers (release grip)\n3. Object drops/rests on surface\n4. Withdraw hand\n5. No longer holding object\n\nTHROWING:\n1. Hold object in hand\n2. Cock arm back\n3. Accelerate arm forward\n4. Release object at apex\n5. Object flies through air (trajectory depends on force/angle)\n6. Object lands/hits target\n\nDROPPING:\n1. Holding object\n2. Accidentally lose grip (if clumsy, startled, etc.)\n3. Object falls (gravity: 9.8 m/s²)\n4. Hits ground with thud/crash/splatter (depends on object)\n5. May break/spill (depends on object fragility)\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\"Katherine is holding a cup of tea. She's startled by a loud \nnoise. Her fingers spasm open involuntarily. The cup drops from \nher hand.\n\nIt falls ~1 meter to the wooden floor (time: ~0.45 seconds). \nThe cup hits the floor - ceramic shatters, hot tea splashes \neverywhere. She jumps back instinctively to avoid the hot \nliquid hitting her feet.\n\nThe cup is now broken. Tea is spilled on floor. She'll need \nto clean this up.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 LINE OF SIGHT & VISIBILITY\n\n### What Can Katherine See?\n\n```\nFACTORS:\n1. POSITION: Where is she?\n2. ORIENTATION: Where is she looking?\n3. OBSTACLES: What blocks view?\n4. DISTANCE: How far away is target?\n5. LIGHTING: Enough light to see?\n\nEXAMPLE 1: Katherine in bedroom, Dev downstairs\n\n\"Katherine is upstairs in the bedroom. Dev is downstairs in \nthe kitchen. The bedroom door is open, but the staircase is \nbetween them.

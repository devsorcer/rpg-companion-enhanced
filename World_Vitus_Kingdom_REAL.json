Those with magical ability are valued for their skills.\n\n**Government:** Monarchy with a King who rules from Vitus Palace in the capital city.\n\n**Development:** Cities are small and underdeveloped compared to larger kingdoms. Most settlements are villages or towns. Architecture is timber-framed buildings, stone structures, and castles.\n\n**Geography:** Diverse terrain including forests, plains, rivers, and mountains. Much of the kingdom is wilderness with settlements scattered throughout.\n\n**Population:** Mostly human, with some magical beings and beast-folk living peacefully.\n\n**Current Era:** Medieval fantasy period with magic integrated into daily life.", "constant": false, "vectorized": false, "selective": true, "selectiveLogic": 0, "addMemo": false, "order": 100, "position": 10, "disable": false, "ignoreBudget": false, "excludeRecursion": false, "preventRecursion": false, "matchPersonaDescription": false, "matchCharacterDescription": false, "matchCharacterPersonality": false, "matchCharacterDepthPrompt": false, "matchScenario": false, "matchCreatorNotes": false, "delayUntilRecursion": 0, "probability": 100, "useProbability": true, "depth": 4, "outletName": "", "group": "", "groupOverride": false, "groupWeight": 100, "scanDepth": null, "caseSensitive": null, "matchWholeWords": null, "useGroupScoring": null, "automationId": "", "role": null, "sticky": null, "cooldown": null, "delay": null, "triggers": [], "displayIndex": 0, "characterFilter": {"isExclude": false, "names": [], "tags": []}}, "1": {"uid": 1, "key": ["Fernwick", "Fernwick village", "the village", "village"], "keysecondary": [], "comment": "Fernwick", "content": "**FERNWICK VILLAGE**\n\nFernwick is a small, isolated village deep within the Thornwood Forest in Vitus Kingdom.
